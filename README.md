# avl_tree_insertion

* Self-balancing Binary Search Tree.  
* Difference between heights of left and right subtrees can not be more than one for all nodes.  
* Most of BST operations take O(height) time.  
* If we make sure that height of the tree remains O(Log n) after every insertion and deletion, then we can guarantee an upper bound of O(Log n) for all these operations.
